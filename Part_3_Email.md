# Part 3 of Fetch Assignment: Email/Slack message

Hi there!

We did some analysis on ~3 months of data to specifically look at: 

	1. The top five brands among users over 20
	2. The breakout of Health & Wellness sales by generation
	3. The leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category

Before diving into the results, it’s important to note that the sample size is very small and that these insights should be for directional, not diagnostic, purposes. It’s also worth mentioning that there were data quality issues, in that there were missing sales and quantity data in this ~3 month period of data.

I will need to reach out to the Data Integrity and AE teams to see what we can do about the quality and accuracy of the data before we can share this out to a client!

With that in mind, here are our results:

1.	We found that the top five brands with the highest receipt upload count for those over 20 were Nerds, Dove, Coca-Cola, Great Value, and Hershey’s.
This is one area where we will want to gather more data before we draw any conclusions.  The sample size here was extremely limiting and further research is needed to more accurately identify top brands within a demographic segment.
2.	 We saw that the breakout of Health & Wellness sales by generation was the following: 
	Gen X: 22%
	Millennial: 31%
	Boomer: 47%
An interesting finding here was that Boomers have the highest percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category. It would need further investigation due to small sample size and missing sales data, but it might be worth targeting both Boomers with their specific Health & Wellness needs, as well as younger demographics to increase their saturation within the category.
3.	When looking at the Dips & Salsa category, we chose to look at which brand had the highest number of sales in the period to identify the “leading” brand in the category. We saw that Tostito’s drove the most sales dollars in the ~3 month period.  
Further data is also needed here due to missing sales data, however it is worth noting that non-Tostito’s Dips & Salsa category campaigns can benefit from this knowledge to target competitive buyers. It’s also useful within the context of a co-branded offer, for example during Super Bowl season, that Tostito’s can help drive sales.
